    <p>While the program won’t have any hard pre-requisites, the staff team tends to have careers in STEM, so comfort with mathematics is recommended, but not a requirement.</p>

  <div class="faq-question">Why are you running this program?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    <p>The program is inspired by programs like <a href="http://sparc.camp" target="_blank">SPARC</a>, which has been operating since 2012.</p>
    <p>We think the ability to model the world, introspect on one’s own experience, and implement one’s vision are all crucial, yet often neglected, skills in one’s education. There is much room for expressing interesting and effective means of honing these skills and we are particularly interested in how this could work in an East Asian context.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-question">Will this program be run in English?</div>

    <p>The program will be run in English. Though most staff members are proficient in Chinese. It is recommended that you are comfortable in an English speaking environment.</p>
    <p>That said, if you are interested in applying, we strongly encourage you to do so, even if you might not be sure your English isn’t up to par! We are looking for participants with high willingness to participate, not perfect English abilities.</p>
